# CC generator merge rules
# Defines how to aggregate attributes when merging combined cycle generators
cc_merge_rules:
  # p_nom is always summed (hardcoded)
  build_year: oldest      # Use the oldest (minimum) build year
  capital_cost: largest   # Use the largest (maximum) capital cost
  p_nom: sum
  others: p_nom
  name: cc_group
  # Add more rules as needed:
  # attribute_name: rule
  #
  # Available rules:
  #   - oldest: Use minimum value (for years, dates)
  #   - newest: Use maximum value (for years, dates)
  #   - largest: Use maximum value (for costs, capacities)
  #   - smallest: Use minimum value
  #   - p_nom: Use value from generator with largest p_nom
  #   - sum: Sum all values
  #   - mean: Average of all values
  #   - remove: Remove this attribute from merged generator
