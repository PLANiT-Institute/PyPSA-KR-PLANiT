# CC generator merge rules
# Defines how to aggregate attributes when merging combined cycle generators
cc_merge_rules:
  # p_nom is always summed (hardcoded)
  build_year: oldest      # Use the oldest (minimum) build year
  capital_cost: largest   # Use the largest (maximum) capital cost
  p_nom: sum
  others: p_nom
  name: cc_group
  # Add more rules as needed:
  # attribute_name: rule
  #
  # Available rules:
  #   - oldest: Use minimum value (for years, dates)
  #   - newest: Use maximum value (for years, dates)
  #   - largest: Use maximum value (for costs, capacities)
  #   - smallest: Use minimum value
  #   - p_nom: Use value from generator with largest p_nom
  #   - sum: Sum all values
  #   - mean: Average of all values
  #   - remove: Remove this attribute from merged generator

# Generator aggregator rules
# Defines how to aggregate attributes when aggregating generators by carrier
generator_aggregator_rules:
  carrier: carrier        # Use the carrier value itself
  bus: p_nom              # Use bus from generator with largest p_nom
  p_nom: sum              # Sum all p_nom values
  build_year: oldest      # Use the oldest build year
  capital_cost: mean      # Use mean capital cost
  marginal_cost: mean     # Use mean marginal cost
  efficiency: mean        # Use mean efficiency

  # Remove custom attributes that don't make sense when aggregated
  address: remove
  province: remove
  company: remove
  membership: remove
  market: remove
  control: remove
  cc_group: remove
  name: remove

  # Default rule for unspecified attributes
  others: sum
