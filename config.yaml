# Monthly time-series data file path
monthly_data:
  file_path: "data/add/monthly_t.csv"

# Snapshot-level data file path
snapshot_data:
  file_path: "data/add/snapshot_t.csv"

# Regional settings
regional_settings:
  national_region: "KR"

# Base data file path
Base_year:
  year: 2024

  - 2024

# CC generator merge rules
# Defines how to aggregate attributes when merging combined cycle generators
cc_merge_rules:
  # p_nom is always summed (hardcoded)
  build_year: oldest      # Use the oldest (minimum) build year
  capital_cost: largest   # Use the largest (maximum) capital cost
  p_nom: sum
  others: p_nom
  name: cc_group
  # Add more rules as needed:
  # attribute_name: rule
  #
  # Available rules:
  #   - oldest: Use minimum value (for years, dates)
  #   - newest: Use maximum value (for years, dates)
  #   - largest: Use maximum value (for costs, capacities)
  #   - smallest: Use minimum value
  #   - p_nom: Use value from generator with largest p_nom
  #   - sum: Sum all values
  #   - mean: Average of all values
